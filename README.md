# Guess-Number
This is a Guess the Number (1 to 10) Game I coded in Python.  
Feel free to look at my code. Comments have been left to better understand my logic.  
While loops, conditions, formatting, importing, variables, and key functions can all be found in my code.
In the future, I may look into giving the user a choice in the number of tries and range of numbers possible.  
Coded with Python 3.
